Everyone did their part in implementing their code and pushing it to their branch.  
- Swathi implemented Ghost
- Nico implemented Player
- Craig implemented Item
- Jeffrey implemented GameBoard
We all made sure to check our pull requests and merge them to the main branch. 
After testing, Swathi was able to find the bug about the score not displaying in main.
Another team opened the issue before she was able to, so she refrained.
Overall, everyone did their part and pulled their weight. 

In part two of the Pacman project, the work was distributed evenly by having Nico and Jeffrey
work on steps 1 and 2 and Craig and Swathi work on steps 3 and 4. Everyone's work 
was reviewed and checked to make sure we stayed on the same page. Overall, great team effort from 
everyone.

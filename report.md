PacMan pt 2

Everyone did their part by helping the team in completeing the 4 objectives.  
- Swathi implemented CI/CD
- Nico renamed components and stopped tracking .env
- Jeffrey reviewed code conflicts and approved PR requests
- Craig removed the .env file from past commits. 

We collaborated using pull request conversations and a groupchat.
We successfully implemented changes on feature branches first and
then used PRs to merge. We used the CI/CD file to test incoming changes
before merging. Finally we modified the commit history using filter-repo.

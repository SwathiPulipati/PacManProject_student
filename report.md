Everyone did their part in implementing their code and pushing it to their branch.  
- Swathi implemented Ghost
- Nico implemented Player
- Craig implemented Item
- Jeffrey implemented GameBoard
We all made sure to check our pull requests and merge them to the main branch. 
After testing, Swathi was able to find the bug about the score not displaying in main.
Another team opened the issue before she was able to, so she refrained.
Overall, everyone did their part and pulled their weight.
